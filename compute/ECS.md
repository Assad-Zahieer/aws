# Elastic Container Service
## Overview
* ECS - highly scalable container (docker) orchestration service
* ECS cluster - grouping of container instances run on EC2 or Fargate
* AWS Fargate - engine allows ECS to run container without need of EC2 instances
* Managed service - monitoring via cloudwatch
* Container - Everything app needs to run (no OS)
    * portable, scalable
## 1. Launching
*  Fargate requires less configuration than EC2, more control of EC2
## 2. Clusters
* ECS is region specific
* Clusters are dynamically scalable across *single region*
